Counts how many syllables are in a number when said out loud.
Integers only. (May be updated in the future)

For example:  <br>
5, or "five", is 1 syllable, <br>
12345, or "twelve thousand, three hundered fourty five", is 9 syllables,  <br>
and -777, or "negative seven hundered seventy seven", is 12 syllables.  <br>

You can also create a graph of how the number of syllables changes over time. <br>
Run "main.py" to do either through the terminal, and download "count.py" if you just want the counting function.
